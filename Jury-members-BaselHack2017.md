Elizaveta (Liza) Semenova is a Ph.D. candidate in Epidemiology and Biostatistics at Swiss Tropical and Public Health Institute, affiliated at the University of Basel. In her research she develops statistical and mathematical methods to analyse surveillance spatiotemporal data. <br>

Beyond academia, Elizaveta was noticed at a number of hackathons in Switzerland: frequently as a participant and thrice as a winner. This time she is curious to try on the role of a jury member.  <br>

Pursuing her passion for community building, Liza has recently joined the board of an organization called “women++” (www.womenplusplus.ch) fostering diversity in tech. The upcoming events, where she will significantly contribute, include a robotics workshop in November 2017 and a Machine Learning session at Applied Machine Learning Days in EPFL in January 2018. <br>

Feel free to contact her via elizaveta.p.semenova@gmail.com

BaselHack is a great opportunity for the tri-national Basel-Mulhouse-Freiburg area - to further strengthen our position in information technology. <br>

Hackathons are a great way to experiment with a new programming language or API. Hackathons are also a nice way to learn from other participants with different skills. <br>
