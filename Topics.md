### template for a topic description "nearest-free-BS-parking-space"
**Problem:**
The search for available parking space frequently wastes time and resources, if required to enter densely constructed areas by car.

**Data resources:**
The city of Basel provides real-time information on the occupation of the majority of the public and private parking buildings via [RSS-feeds](http://www.parkleitsystem-basel.ch/rss_feed.php).
    
**proposed hack topic:**
We propose to incorporate this information into a mobile routing app (eg https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/directions/intro?hl=en) to guide users to the closest available parking space, including information on parking fees, and permitted duration of occupation. An additional innovative aspect is a proof-of-concept inclusion of open space parking. The topic includes the ad-hoc monitoring of selected parking spots with IoT-enabled smart parking sensor (eg https://www.pnicorp.com/placepod/ ) and their integration into a LoRaWAN network.

## Time-based prevoyance as the fourth pillar of old-age provision

### Pitch
Over the next 30 years, Switzerland will face up to 50% more pensioners [1]. The institutions and funds for old-age provision (AVH, BVG, 3rd pillar) and the healthcare sector are increasingly under financial stress. To counter this trend, several associations have been established in Switzerland to offer a voluntary, time-based 4th pillar [2]: retirees can collect time credits in the "younger" years during which they take care of elderly retirees (e.g. go shopping, take them for a walk, etc.). Later, once they themselves are dependent on help, they can redeem the collected time credits at local associations. This time-based prevoyance provides financial relief for old-aged provision, promotes intergenerational justice, and helps elderly staying in their homes longer.

### Goal at the BaselHack
Develop a system to make time-keeping efficient, and allow the participating associations to easily manage time credits. We aim to deliver a proof-of-concept solution for creating, managing, and redeeming time credits. To avoid fraud, important pieces of metadata relating to the time credits will be stored in a blockchain / wallet.
