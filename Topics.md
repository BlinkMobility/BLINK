### template for a topic description "nearest-free-BS-parking-space"
**Problem:**
The search for available parking space frequently wastes time and resources, if required to enter densely constructed areas by car.

**Data resources:**
The city of Basel provides real-time information on the occupation of the majority of the public and private parking buildings via [RSS-feeds](http://www.parkleitsystem-basel.ch/rss_feed.php).
    
**proposed hack topic:**
We propose to incorporate this information into a mobile routing app (eg https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/directions/intro?hl=en) to guide users to the closest available parking space, including information on parking fees, and permitted duration of occupation. An additional innovative aspect is a proof-of-concept inclusion of open space parking. The topic includes the ad-hoc monitoring of selected parking spots with IoT-enabled smart parking sensor (eg https://www.pnicorp.com/placepod/ ) and their integration into a LoRaWAN network.

## Project: Time-based prevoyance as the fourth pillar of old-age provision

### Team

### Pitch
Over the next 30 years, Switzerland will face up to 50% more pensioners [1]. The institutions and funds for old-age provision (AVH, BVG, 3rd pillar) and the healthcare sector are increasingly in financial distress. To counter this new financial burden, the idea of ​​a voluntary, time-based fourth pillar is imposing itself. For this purpose, several associations have been established in Switzerland recently [2]. The system of time-based prevoyance is simple: retirees can collect time credits in the "younger" years during which they take care of elderly retirees. Later, once they themselves are dependent on help, they can redeem the collected time credits at local associations. This time-based prevoyance provides financial relief and promotes intergenerational justice.

### Goal at the BaselHack
Develop an IT-based, decentralized administration system to make time-keeping efficient, and allow the participating associations to easily manage time credits. During the BaselHack, we aim to deliver a proof-of-concept solution for creating, managing, and redeeming time credits. To avoid fraud, important pieces of metadata relating to the time credits will be stored in a blockchain / wallet.
