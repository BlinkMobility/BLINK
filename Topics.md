### template for a topic description "nearest-free-BS-parking-space"
**Problem:**
The search for available parking space frequently wastes time and resources, if required to enter densely constructed areas by car.

**Data resources:**
The city of Basel provides real-time information on the occupation of the majority of the public and private parking buildings via [RSS-feeds](http://www.parkleitsystem-basel.ch/rss_feed.php).
    
**proposed hack topic:**
We propose to incorporate this information into a mobile routing app (eg https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/directions/intro?hl=en) to guide users to the closest available parking space, including information on parking fees, and permitted duration of occupation. An additional innovative aspect is a proof-of-concept inclusion of open space parking. The topic includes the ad-hoc monitoring of selected parking spots with IoT-enabled smart parking sensor (eg https://www.pnicorp.com/placepod/ ) and their integration into a LoRaWAN network.
