You are interested in the BaselHack, you have considerable experience in software development and/or the Basel area, and you would like to contribute in other ways than joining a single hacking team?

### => The BaselHack2017 features the role of coaches for this purpose

A few minimal rules:
- you are available to any team requesting a slot for ~5-30min consulting
- your contributions are fully transparent (ideally via the corresponding [github project site](https://github.com/BaselHack/BaselHack2017/projects))


If interested please contact us via jury-admin@baselhack.ch with the following information (which will be published on this page)

* **name**, **photo**, and **professional role** relevant for hackathon: [organizer, coder, artist, ...]
* **I can coach on**: <br>
   [1-10 keywords, referring to IT and data skills, but also team building and organization, presentation, ...]
* **preferred contact channel** during the hackathon:  <br>

      your github user name,  <br>
